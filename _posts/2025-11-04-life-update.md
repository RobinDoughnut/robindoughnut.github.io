Been a while since I wrote anything here. Time moves pretty fast when your life is falling apart. I want to write here, to learn about the world and myself.

### What’s the plan?
In my final year of being a undergrad student. Still have no idea how I survived this long. It was not bad and not great. Met some awesome people in my university. Also shoutout to **8 no. gate**.

### What I have been doing
Here are some stuff that is related to my degree I have been doing (or trying to do):
- trying to understand the transformer archticture and how we can use it for domain adaptation (bangla nlp)
- exploring computer vision by detecting defects in foil stamping (anomaly detection)
- made some mediocre websites(static and dynamic) for companies, used vps, wordpress, php, (linux for vps)
- read a paper on image restoration using open ai clip model which was fun and traumatising
- prompt engineering (mostly this)
